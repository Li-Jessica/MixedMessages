# Mixed Messages
The purpose of this program is to display cute and positive messages. This will be accomplished with javascript and displayed with html and css styling. 

## Process
1. User clicks on button.
2. Program randomly picks a compliment from an array and displays it onto the screen with a cute image.
3. Processes 1-2 repeat until user decides to close the program. 

## Future Potential Features  
- Improve shuffling of compliments (e.g. keep random shuffling, but reset when user has seen each compliment once to remove duplicates)
- Add another messsage generator (e.g. add nav bar for different themes)
